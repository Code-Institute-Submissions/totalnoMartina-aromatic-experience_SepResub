# Project Overview

Aromatic Experience is a blog started by a passionate individual who wants the world to know about benefits of oils. Educated in Herbalism and a Representative of [Doterra](https://www.doterra.com/GB/en_GB), I am creating this website for all lovers of aromatherapy and 'DYI' blends that can be shared in this platform. With an option to like/unlike a post or leave a comment.

# User Experience Design

## Strategy
As a small business owner, a representative for Doterra Company, I want to have a way to promote the importance of using essential oils in every day life. The strategy here is to start small, gather a community and together smell the roses. I could possibly make more income based on this blog, since audience will know my secret recipes here. Main Objective: To grow.

### Target audience

- Users passionate about skin/hair/nails care in natural ways
- Users interested in healing with sense of smell
- Users looking for natural ways to improve their wellbeing
- Users who want to share their ideas about oils and mixing them
- Users who dont know anything about oils but have a keen interest to find out
- Users who have some emotional imbalance and looking for natural way of getting back to balance
- Users who want to connect to more alike-thinkers


### User stories

**First-time User:**

1. I want to understand the purpose of the site and the topic objective easily
2. I want to easily register an account, possibly using social media account
3. I want to feel confident that the data I enter is secure
4. I want to understand the benefits of creating an account
5. I want to connect to new people by commenting, liking posts

**Returning Users:**

1. I want to easily log back into my account
2. I want to be able to see the latest posts displaying in the homepage
3. I want to be able to have good Ux in all versions pf screens

**Site administrator:**

1. I want to log in quickly and easily
2. I want to see what comments have been recently requested to be published
3. I want to have an option on my navigation to go straight to Admnistration when logged in


## Scope

Mostly for a small business owners usage, possibly for the ones who work from home, even though it is easily maintained to be a regular little hobby on the side. And the scope here is to be topic oriented, targeting aromatherapy benefits and connect all interested with the commenting feature, providing relevant informations. Help small business connected to aromatherapy grow.
### Features

- Authentication System - Users can login and easily comment/like
- Administrator can mainpulate comments that are going to be published, approve them
- Facebook login set up (At the moment, there is a bug, which does not allow login using Facebook, but it worked once before, so I keep trying)

**Future features**

- Add an oil review section/category - where users can review oils from specific companie and share amongst each other which are high/low quality
- Add login using Google
- Inspired by the app called [abillion](https://www.abillion.com/) it would be great to make every review giving users 1Euro for every review they make and then, this one euro would go to a specific company that already is involved in production of oils or contributing in some way, as this can be collected and donated. No money can be withdrawn, which makes it even more noble. 

## Structure

A Structure of this Website is aiming to be simple, with warm color palette and a simple navbar. The content main objective is in the center split into two columns when seeing published posts.While seeing one post, the title and front image streches to imporve visual experience.
