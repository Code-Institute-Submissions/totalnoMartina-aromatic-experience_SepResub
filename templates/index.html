                <h3>How This All Started</h3>
                <p>Welcome and thank you, dear reader, for being here with me on this interesting
                    journey covered in herbs, flowers and plant-power.
                    I have been working with
                    <a href="https://www.doterra.com/GB/en_GB" class="dotera" target="_blank">Doterra</a>
                    Company with distributing
                    collections of essential oils, and all this from home. Recently,
                    I came to realize that my friends enjoy the blends I come up with
                    and have been encouraging me to share my insights on this topic.
                    As I am also a writer, I decided to take up on this challenge and
                    create a community platform for all of us passionate about blends
                    and essential oils. I hope we all put together a nice collection of
                    blended oils for any occasion. If you have some ideas and would like
                    to contribute to this platform, feel free to leave a comment relating
                    to this, and I am happy to have a video call.

                <h3>Oils origin</h3>
                <p>
                    A variety of plants cover the Earth in different shapes,
                    sizes, colors, and scents. Many of these plants contain
                    compounds that typically can't be seen with the naked eyeâ€”they
                    hide within the roots, flowers, seeds, bark, or other areas of
                    the plant. These compounds are known as essential oils. They are
                    highly concentrated, making them extremely potent. Also referred
                    to as volatile aromatic compounds, essential oils give a plant its
                    aroma, protect it from harsh environmental conditions and insects,
                    and even play a part in plant pollination.
